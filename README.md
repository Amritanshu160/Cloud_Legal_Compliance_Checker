# ☁️ Cloud Legal Compliance Checker

**Cloud Legal Compliance Checker** is a minimal Flask-based web tool that allows users to submit cloud policy content or legal text through a web interface. The tool saves submitted inputs to the server for offline review, auditing, or future compliance checks.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This tool acts as a basic input interface for organizations or developers who want to:
- Collect cloud compliance declarations or text snippets
- Log policy submissions for auditing
- Process or analyze legal documents in a later pipeline

*Think of it as a building block for a larger cloud governance/compliance automation system.*

## ✨ Features

- 🖥️ Web form to collect compliance-related inputs
- 📁 Saves inputs as files for offline processing
- 📝 Easy-to-extend for text parsing, PDF generation, or database storage
- 🔒 No dependencies on cloud platforms — lightweight and self-hosted

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask** – lightweight web framework
- **Jinja2** – for HTML templating
